This is a report produced by [X-lab](http://www.x-lab.info/) and jointly completed with several scientific institutions. We wish to share the insights and metrics that were digged out through GitHub collaboration data with CHAOSS.

Open source software has become a cornerstone of our digital world, and open collaboration plays an enormous role in the development of human digital civilization.

**GitHub**, the world's largest open source collaboration platform, produced a massive amount of developer behavior data.

We obtained **860 million** event logs generated in 2020 and analyzed **14.54 million** active developers and **54.21 million** active projects.

What have we learned?
