# Introducing CHAOSScast

by Georg Link

CHAOSS has come a long way since founded in 2017 and is primed to go much further. It has expanded in major ways. We now have:

* 6 working groups
* 40 defined metrics
* 5 CHAOSScon have run internationally
* Many updates to metric tools in GrimoireLab 
* A new streamlined metric platform called Augur

We have made the CHAOSS community a **vibrant place of activity** that brings together diverse people from across the open source ecosystem who are interested in understanding, measuring, and analyzing open source community health. And we are now expanding our community in one more way

**With [CHAOSScast](https://podcast.chaoss.community/), the CHAOSS community is growing even further!**

The goal of this community podcast is to share use cases and experience with measuring open source community health. We want to elevate conversations around metrics, analytics, and software for open source community health. 

The podcast will fill an important gap in the CHAOSS community. We will invite guests to speak about their unique use cases and experiences. These are stories we would have a hard time sharing otherwise.
