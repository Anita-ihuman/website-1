## About CHAOSScon Africa
CHAOSScon Africa is a conference that brings together developers, designers, community managers, and others interested in contributing or building open source software. 
Join us for this one-day event to learn about open source and how you might get started contributing to an open source project, connect with others who are new to open source and meet the members of CHAOSScon Africa.
