# CHAOSS D&I WG on The New Stack

A [contributed article on The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io/how-chaoss-di-can-help-diversity-in-the-open-source-community/) details how the CHAOSS D&I Working Group got started and evolved. Georg Link and Sarah Conway take a close look at the working group's history and capture insights that are only known to those who were part of the evolution. The article outline is:

* History of the CHAOSS project
* Rise of the CHAOSS D&I Working Group
* Creating D&I Metrics
* Whatâ€™s Next for CHAOSS D&I WG

The New Stack staff also interviewed Georg Link and Nicole Huesman about the CHAOSS D&I Working Group for their [podcast](https://thenewstack.io/how-chaoss-measures-diversity-windows-gets-a-proper-terminal/). Questions they answer are:

* How did you get involved with the CHAOSS project?
* How did the CHAOSS project come about? Why was the Linux Foundation interested in creating a standard set of metrics for open source projects?
* What were the initial metrics that people were interested in measuring? What were they trying to learn about their projects that fueled that initial interest?
* What are the questions and metrics that you would use to quantify diversity and inclusion?
* How is CHAOSS measuring results of diversity and inclusion? What are good metrics to use as indicators?
* What is the plan for getting diversity and inclusion metrics out to individual projects and supporting them with using the metrics?
* Why do people want metrics? What do they want to use them for? How does it improve software delivery?
* How to get involved in the CHAOSS project?
