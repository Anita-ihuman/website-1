# Understanding Project Health at VMware with CHAOSS

By [Dawn Foster](https://fastwonderblog.com/)

When Pivotal was recently acquired by VMware, I joined VMware's 
Open Source Program Office to lead
the open source community strategy efforts. As an active CHAOSS
community member, one of the first things I did while I was building
the strategy was to start gathering metrics so that I could better 
understand the health of our current open source projects 
while also understanding where we could improve.

My passion for the CHAOSS project and open source metrics resulted in
a short video interview (<8 minutes) where I talked about CHAOSS
and how we are using Augur to generate project health metrics.

I hope you enjoy watching it as much as I enjoyed recording it!
