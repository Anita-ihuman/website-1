**GrimoireLab History**

GrimoireLab is a set of tools to retrieve, organize, analyze, and visualize data coming
from software development repositories. Many things have changed since the last time
GrimoireLab was at CHAOSScon: new functionalities, a pair of successful Google Summer of
Code projects, OpenSearch support. In this talk, we will introduce the new features and
components of the platform and the brand new roadmap for the near future.

**GrimoireLab Use Cases**

Users of GrimoireLab share how they are using the tools. Speakers to be confirmed.

**Workshop 1: Notebooks for Data Cooking**

_Showcase how to use GrimoireLab data using Notebooks_ - 
Free software like GrimoireLab and Python notebooks excel at allowing you to process the
collected data in any way you want. Your imagination is the limit! In this workshop we’ll
show you how to leverage Python notebooks to play with data collected by GrimoireLab.
Comment your use case on Slack or the mailing list so we adapt the examples!

**Workshop 2: Find Your Newcomers**

_Identify new members of the community - Metric of the Month_ - 
Welcoming, helping and encouraging your newcomers as they join your community are key
practices for retention. Visualizations and metrics help you monitor how they are doing.
And identifying them is the first step.

**Workshop 3: Network Graphs for Fun & ...Insights**

_Network Analysis_ - 
Network graphs are eye candy and impressive. And GrimoireLab provides them. Learn how to
use them for exploring your data and then tune them for getting your point across …or just
for showing-off, why not?  B-)

**Augur Threads**

There are many parts of Augur to use, and Contribute to.

**Thread 1: Front End with OSS-Aspen**

_Showcasing Wide, Deep Data with OSS-Aspen_ - 
OSS-Aspen is a new and compelling Dash/Plotly based interface for Augur that leverages Augur's rich and complete data! You will learn how to quickly visualize anything you can imagine across a prepared collection of over 20,000 repositories.

**Thread 2: Augur Installation and Configuration**

_Installing and Configuring Augur_ - 
Learn how to get started quickly, and collect data for any repository you are interested in!

**Thread 3: Ecosystem Networks: Communication and Contribution Across Projects**

_Network Analysis_ - 
No single project, or collection of projects exists in isolation. The technical strategies, communication and work are usually spread across numerous other projects, and project dependencies. Learn how to take an ecosystem level of view of CHAOSS Metrics and Metric Models.
