### Join us for CHAOSS Community and **Working Group** video conferences

Because transparency is one of our core values, we record and publish all community and Working Group calls to [CHAOSStube](https://www.youtube.com/c/CHAOSStube) (our YouTube channel). This should not deter you from participating if you would prefer to keep your information private! Here are a few adjustments you can make to safely join the calls:

- Keep your camera turned off during the call
- Make sure your real name isn't shown in your Zoom settings
- Instead of speaking, use Zoom's chat functionality to communicate (we heavily integrate chats into the flow of voice conversation)

We hope you'll join us!
