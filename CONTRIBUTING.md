# CHAOSS Website - Content, Issues, Requests and Edits

The CHAOSS website is a Wordpress site. Portions of content in our site are pulled directly from GitHub markdown files.

## How to contribute
We welcome suggestions and edits to any document on our website. This includes all our Community Documentation, our Metrics and Metrics Models pages, and any information that has been published about CHAOSS. The only exception is our Project Charter, in which any change requires approval from our Governing Board.

Before contributing, there are a few steps we encourage our newcomers to take, in order to familiarize yourself with CHAOSS and the general contribution process. Please see the community CONTRIBUTING.md for more information.

## Repository specific guidelines
* For general issues, please use the Issues 
* For content requests, edits, and enhancements, please use Pull requests

Content requests could include upcoming events you would like to see posted on the site, project specific information, or requested edits.

## CHAOSSweekly News Submissions
To submit a blurb for the [CHAOSSweekly Newsletter](https://chaoss.community/news/) you can reach out to Elizabeth Barron (@ElizabethN) or submit an issue in this repository with the information. 

## Blog Posts
To submit a blog post for publication in the CHAOSS blog, compose your document using Google Docs, and then share that doc with Elizabeth Barron (@ElizabethN) for review. Elizabeth will work with you to get your blog posted to the Wordpress site.

## Wordpress/Github Markdown Content

The site is built using GitHub content areas. Editing content in the associated GitHub markdown files will edit content on the Wordpress production site.

Because the website content is distributed across several GitHub repositories, each editable page in the CHAOSS website has a link at the bottom of the page where comments, suggestions, and edits can be proposed. 

To edit these content areas, please fork the appropriate repo, make changes to the markdown files, and submit a pull request.

You may also submit an issue in this repository if you see something that needs updating.

For questions, please open an issue in this repository.
