**GrimoireLab History**

GrimoireLab is a set of tools to retrieve, organize, analyze, and visualize data coming
from software development repositories. Many things have changed since the last time
GrimoireLab was at CHAOSScon: new functionalities, a pair of successful Google Summer of
Code projects, OpenSearch support. In this talk, we will introduce the new features and
components of the platform and the brand new roadmap for the near future.

**GrimoireLab Use Cases**

Users of GrimoireLab share how they are using the tools. Speakers to be confirmed.

**Workshop 1: Notebooks for Data Cooking**

_Showcase how to use GrimoireLab data using Notebooks_ - 
Free software like GrimoireLab and Python notebooks excel at allowing you to process the
collected data in any way you want. Your imagination is the limit! In this workshop we’ll
show you how to leverage Python notebooks to play with data collected by GrimoireLab.
Comment your use case on Slack or the mailing list so we adapt the examples!

**Workshop 2: Find Your Newcomers**

_Identify new members of the community - Metric of the Month_ - 
Welcoming, helping and encouraging your newcomers as they join your community are key
practices for retention. Visualizations and metrics help you monitor how they are doing.
And identifying them is the first step.

**Workshop 3: Network Graphs for Fun & ...Insights**

_Network Analysis_ - 
Network graphs are eye candy and impressive. And GrimoireLab provides them. Learn how to
use them for exploring your data and then tune them for getting your point across …or just
for showing-off, why not?  B-)
