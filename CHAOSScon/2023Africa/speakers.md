**Talk Title:**
	The Open Source Launchpad: A Then & now look at tech careers
  
**Talk abstract:**

Open Source is “everything, everywhere, all at once.” In 2022, GitHub reported over 94 million developers using the platform and over 3.5 billion contributions recorded on the platform. While GitHub does not only have Open Source projects, it is impossible to ignore the changing drumbeat and record investments made into “Open Work” over the last ten years. But when people say “open source” and “free software,” what exactly do they mean? How do we define “free stuff” and what different ways do we produce this “free stuff?” Furthermore, how are companies, businesses, governments, and international NGOs providing opportunities, careers, and jobs to work on “free stuff?”
 
In this talk, Justin W. Flory will pull the curtain back on the past 40 years of “free & open source,” how we got to where we are today, and advice on how to find competitive careers working on open source products and with open source communities. Justin pulls from both public history and his own personal experience as an open-source contributor for the last 10 years, beginning when he was a high school student. Attendees will leave with a better understanding of the different ways “free & open source” are used in industry and gain insight into how open source projects can act as a launchpad for a technology career.

**Talk Title:**
	A Day in the Life of an Open Source Designer.

**Talk abstract:**
After being released from an internship one month in due to reasons unknown to me, I had no idea what to do next. I discovered the world of open source via Twitter through Victory Brown and Anita iHuman’s tweets about Layer5 looking for designers. Three months later, I was recognized for my cultural alignment with their shared success model and was awarded a community member profile for my efforts. How did I achieve success so fast, and what were the pitfalls I discovered along the way? I would like to share my day in the life of a product designer contributing to open source.

**Talk Title:**
	Identifying Open Source Ecosystems Using Network Analysis, Artificial Intelligence, and Dependency Patterns

**Talk abstract:**
Come with me to the edge of possibility. At the junction of a free thought-centered movement to build and share software in public spaces free of charge and the social and technical complexities of maintaining an ever-growing software maintenance weight, we find “Open-Source Software.” To newcomers, a singular place where remote work happens, somehow, on GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. In this talk, I will Illustrate the Application of CHAOSS Metrics, Dynamic Networks of people and artifacts, and cross-project patterns of dependency utilization and currency.  
This talk will present a view of Professor Goggins’ decade-long pursuit of understanding the complex socio-technical work context of Open-Source Software and include reflections on his deep engagement with the Linux Foundation, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, corporate open-source program offices, Medicare/Medicaid, universities, and scientific enterprises over the past decade. These insights are then supported through the lens of a six-year-old, large-scale software project for gathering electronic trace data about open-source software and analyzing it. 
In this talk, the analysis and insight include existing CHAOSS metrics and an emerging milieu of network analysis, artificial intelligence, and dependency pattern analysis which, together, make it possible to understand ecosystems of open source software that reach beyond our present definitions, which rely nearly entirely on an ecosystem declaring itself to be an ecosystem. 
Participants in the talk will walk away with a clearer view of how to frame research questions related to what is, in the presenter’s view, the largest and most expansive context for distributed work in history. We need ways to study one ecosystem at a time in a gigantic social computing metaverse. This talk is filled with ideas, demonstrations, and insights that build on current work within the CHAOSS project.
