#Metrics and Metrics Models

CHAOSS metrics are identified and defined using a continuous contribution process. The metrics are officially released biannually following a 30 day comment period. CHAOSS metrics were debated in working groups and undergo a 30 day comment period to ensure validity. Released metrics are only a subset of many possible metrics. CHAOSS acknowledges that more metrics exist and is working to identify and release new metrics in the future. If you would like to learn more about metrics, suggest new metrics, and or help define metrics please visit our participate page.

_The CHAOSS project recognizes that there are ethical and legal challenges when using the metrics and software provided by the CHAOSS community. Ethical challenges exist around protecting community members and empowering them with their personal information. Legal challenges exist around GDPR and similar laws or regulations that protect personal information of community members. Particular challenges may arise in the use that is specific to your context._

CHAOSS metrics are sorted into Topic Areas for consumption. Topic areas describe the general context where a metric may used. Metrics may more than one Topic Area. Metrics are searchable by context, measureable phenomena, CHAOSS working groups and related keywords. The metrics include a detail page with definitions, objectives, and examples.
