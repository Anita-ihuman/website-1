# CHAOSS Website
The CHAOSS website is primarily built on a Wordpress infrastructure. There are portions of our website that pull content from GitHub files. Some of those files are hosted here, and others are hosted in the repo of the group where they were developed. Generally speaking:

 - CHAOSS governance and community documentation are housed in the [CHAOSS Community repo](https://github.com/chaoss/community)
 - The CHAOSS Code of Conduct is housed in the [.github repository](https://github.com/chaoss/.github)
 - Metrics and Metrics Models documents are housed in the individual working groups that developed those metrics
 - General information about CHAOSS software is housed in this repository
 - General information about CHAOSScon is housed in this repository

We strive to indicate on each website page where the information is housed, but for a complete mapping, there is a [website spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w0hGLNW7pKerQaAR62PhhiHLrM_4lzi233RaLRsB_8Y/edit#gid=0).
